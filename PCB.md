# PCB layout and footprints (KiCad)

Companion to `SKILL.md`. **Read this file when the task involves the board** —
`.kicad_pcb`, `.kicad_mod`, `pcbnew` scripting, DRC, zones, footprints, land
patterns, stackup or creepage. Schematic-only work does not need it.

Everything in `SKILL.md` still applies here: generate rather than hand-place,
climb the whole verification ladder, and write guards that fail when they cannot
evaluate their input.

## Board-specific rungs of the verification ladder

DRC green means "no rule was broken", not "the design is right". In particular:

```sh
$K pcb drc --severity-all --schematic-parity -o drc.rpt x.kicad_pcb
```

- **`--schematic-parity` is not optional.** It is the only check that the board
  still matches the netlist.
- **A rule area that relaxes a constraint is keyed on *position*.** Anything that
  later moves into it silently stops being held to the strict value, and DRC
  stays green. Any relaxation needs an independent geometric audit that measures
  real clearance (binary-search `SHAPE::Collide`) rather than asking the rules.
- **Re-run the layout script after *any* schematic change**, not just after
  connectivity changes — see the parity note below.

## Decoupling is a current loop, not a placement radius

Validate every datasheet-critical bypass by following actual copper from the IC supply pin to
the capacitor and back to the specified return pin or plane entry. Check both capacitor pads,
vias and layer changes. Centre-to-centre or hot-pad-to-pin Euclidean distance can pass a long,
inductive return path and cannot prove that the capacitor is connected across the required
two nodes.

- Place the smallest/highest-frequency capacitor first and route its loop short and direct;
  keep bulk capacitors from displacing it.
- Verify topology as well as distance. Two capacitors in series through a ground net do not
  implement a datasheet-required direct rail-to-rail capacitor.
- Derive any numeric audit limit from a datasheet, package/application geometry or an explicit
  loop-inductance target. Do not raise a failed limit to the distance the finished placement
  happens to provide and then describe that value as verified.
- Make the audit fail when it cannot reconstruct the complete loop. Reporting only the nearest
  pad-to-pin distance creates a precise number for the wrong property.

## No vias in pads — and DRC will not tell you

KiCad's DRC does **not** flag a via sitting inside a pad. If they share a net it
is simply "connected" — which is how a 0.6 mm via can sit inside an 0805 land
through a full adversarial review. At reflow the via barrel wicks solder out of
the joint; the result is a starved joint that looks fine under a microscope.

Write the check yourself — and make it **net-blind**, because the real cases are
same-net:

```python
for v in vias:
    for ref, p in pads:
        if v.GetEffectiveShape(layer).Collide(p.GetEffectiveShape(layer), mm(0.2)):
            bad.append(...)          # no net comparison anywhere
```

Expect such a scan to find more than was reported: one instance typically comes
with several others (supply and ground vias inside SOIC lands are common) plus a
tail of near-misses in the 0.03–0.19 mm range. **A user reporting one instance of
a class of defect is reporting the class** — scan for all of it, and say what the
scan found.

When a via genuinely has nowhere to go — two chip lands 0.22 mm apart, a SOIC pin
0.5 mm from its decoupler — step it *off the axis* rather than squeezing it
between: run a short stub of track and put the via where there is room.


## The stackup is part of the design, not a fab preference

If the board file has no `(stackup ...)` block, KiCad assumes a default and the
fab builds whatever is cheapest that week — while your design doc quotes
dielectric-dependent numbers (stray capacitance, impedance, creepage class) that
depend on a stackup nobody agreed to. Write it explicitly.

The SWIG `pcbnew` API does not usefully expose `BOARD_STACKUP` (you get an opaque
`SwigPyObject` with no methods), so this has to be a text edit on the saved
`.kicad_pcb`. Anchor it on a regex that captures the existing indentation —
KiCad indents with tabs, and a hardcoded two-space `"\n  (setup\n"` anchor will
not match. **Make the failure loud**: if the anchor is missing, exit; do not
return quietly, or the stackup silently stops being written and every number that
depends on it becomes unbacked. Then verify KiCad *parses* it rather than merely
tolerating it — load and re-save through `pcbnew` and confirm the block survives
the round-trip.


## PCB / `pcbnew` notes

Run layout scripts with KiCad's **bundled** Python — `pcbnew` is not importable from a normal
venv:

```
/Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
```

It prints a harmless `create wxApp before calling this` assert; ignore it. API traps met in
practice: `ZONE` has no `SetDoNotAllowZoneFills`; `LSET & LSET` is not supported; and
`SHAPE::Collide` wants a real `VECTOR2I`, not a tuple. Distances come back in internal units —
`pcbnew.ToMM()` everything before comparing.

**A schematic edit that changes no nets can still break `--schematic-parity`.** Renaming a
symbol's *Value* field desyncs it from the value stored in the `.kicad_pcb` footprint. Re-run
the layout script after any schematic change, not only after connectivity changes.

**Zone fills are a cache.** Changing a clearance *rule* does not move filled copper until
zones are re-filled, so any geometric measurement afterwards is against stale copper. Re-fill
(`ZONE_FILLER`) before measuring, or you will "verify" the previous state. This is a classic
false negative when *calibrating* a clearance guard: tightening the rule to force a violation
appears to do nothing, and the guard looks broken when in fact the test was.

- **A thermal pad wants solid copper, not thermal relief.** Zones default to
  `ZONE_CONNECTION_THERMAL`; spokes on an exposed-pad land starve exactly the
  connection the island exists to make. DRC's `starved_thermal` check catches it
  (`zone min spoke count 2; actual 1`) — set `ZONE_CONNECTION_FULL` on that zone.
- **A track endpoint sitting on top of a zone is not connected to it** if they
  are on different layers. It needs a via. DRC reports this as `track_dangling`
  plus an unconnected item; both point at the same missing via.
- **A via that lands outside its pour is silently unconnected.** Re-placing an LDO
  block 3.5 mm moved its `+5V` pins past the edge of the L3 pour; the plane vias
  then dropped onto bare laminate. Nothing in the placement code knew. After any
  re-place, assert every plane via actually falls inside a filled area of the zone
  it is supposed to reach — or add a zone that covers the strays and assert the
  fill count.


## Making a `pcbnew` layout reproducible — there are two causes, not one

`--repro` on a board fails for a reason the schematic side never hits, and fixing
only the obvious half leaves the md5 still wobbling.

1. **Random UUIDs.** Every track, via, zone and text created through the API gets a
   random UUID, and SWIG exposes `m_Uuid` **read-only** — there is no `SetUuid`. So
   the canonicalisation has to be a string-aware s-expression pass over the *saved*
   file, assigning `uuid5` over each item's own identity (refdes for footprints;
   net/layer/width/coords otherwise, prefixed by the owning footprint's refdes).
2. **Zone fills depend on item order.** KiCad orders items by UUID, and `ZONE_FILLER`'s
   boolean operations walk that order — so with random UUIDs the *fills* came out
   differing run to run by the odd redundant collinear vertex. Geometrically
   identical, textually not, and it defeats any hash comparison.

Therefore: **canonicalise ids and item order first, then fill.** Filling before
canonicalising bakes the old order into the polygons and the md5 keeps moving while
every geometric check reports PASS.


## Geometry helpers are guards, and fail the same way

**A segment-to-segment distance that only compares endpoints reports a large number for
two segments crossing in a perfect X.** One returned **5 mm** for a genuine crossing and
hid **17 real track crossings** from the router's own overlap check. Endpoint-to-endpoint
distance is not segment distance: handle the intersecting case explicitly, then calibrate
by feeding the helper two segments that cross at their midpoints and watching it return 0.

The same applies to any `near()`-style spatial index used to prune clearance checks: if it
ever returns a *subset* of the true neighbours, every clearance check built on it silently
starts passing — absence of evidence encoding absence of the problem. Calibrate it as a
**superset** property against brute force on a real board, not on a toy case.


## Isolated designs: the binding clearance is zone-to-zone, and DRC is not asked

On a board with primary and secondary domains, the minimum copper-to-copper distance almost
never occurs between tracks — it occurs **between the two ground/power pours on the inner
layers**, which is exactly where nobody looks. Measured on one 4-layer board: F.Cu 4.020,
GND 4.000, PWR 4.295, B.Cu 4.000 mm — the two binding numbers were both zone-to-zone.

DRC will not check any of this unless a rule asks it to, so an **independent audit must
measure real geometry on every copper layer**, zones included, and enforce the stated figure.
A secondary track sitting 3.638 mm from primary pads passed DRC cleanly for exactly this
reason. Set the floor *at* the standard, calibrate it by injecting a known-bad geometry, and
scope any package-bridging exemption (an isolator or DC/DC straddles the barrier by
construction) to pairs where **both** items belong to that package **and** touch its pads —
bounded by its own measured floor, so a new object cannot inherit the excuse.

An exemption does **not** satisfy the original requirement. If a package's own measured floor
is below the stated board minimum, report the normal clearance and package deviation
separately and fail release unless the design records an approved waiver or a revised derived
requirement tied to that exact part and working voltage. Never print an overall `PASS >= 4 mm`
for a design whose approved geometry includes 3.5 mm; bounded is not compliant.

**Do not slot a plane to steer digital return current on a precision analog board.** It is
the textbook move and it is usually wrong here: the converter datasheet asks for a
*continuous* return beneath it, and a moat raises the impedance of the **analog** return to
fix a **digital** problem. Solve it with placement — put the noisy return corridor physically
away from the sensitive part and measure the clearance you achieved.


## Modifying a footprint: copper, mask and paste are three independent layers

If you narrow a pad's **copper** for creepage, `F.Mask` and `F.Paste` do **not** follow.
This nearly shipped: an exposed pad was cut 2.95 → 2.00 mm and its mask 2.71 → 1.80 mm for
HV clearance, while the four paste apertures stayed at their original size — printing paste
**2.49 mm wide**, 0.245 mm *outside* the copper and onto bare solder mask, right in the
0.675 mm channel between −15 V and +110 V. Creepage measured on copper said 0.675 mm; the
real post-reflow figure was **0.430 mm**, below IPC-2221B B2.

After editing any pad, measure all three layers:

```python
for layer, name in ((pcbnew.F_Cu,"copper"), (pcbnew.F_Mask,"mask"), (pcbnew.F_Paste,"paste")):
    ...  # min/max extents per layer, then the gap to the nearest foreign-net land
```

Also: **never print paste over an open via barrel** — solder wicks down it. If thermal vias
sit inside the pad's mask opening, either shape the apertures to miss them, or specify
plugged/filled vias (IPC-4761) in the fab notes.
